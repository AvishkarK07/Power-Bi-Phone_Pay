• Customers prefer Regular fat items over Low-fat ones, almost 2:1 ratio.

• This indicates that taste and preference may outweigh health considerations for most consumers.

• For business strategy, Blinkit might focus on maintaining strong availability of regular-fat items, while promoting low-fat options to health-conscious buyers to balance sales.

• The medium-sized outlets are driving the highest revenue, followed by small outlets, while large (high) outlets underperform in comparison.

• This may suggest that medium outlets strike a balance between reach, cost, and efficiency—making them the most effective outlet size in terms of sales generation.

• The outlet establishment values grew steadily for several years, hit a large peak in 2018, and then settled back to a stable level similar to pre-2018 numbers.

• The 2018 surge might indicate a one-time event or investment boom, while the years after show normalization.
